## Building Project

To use Docker to just build your site, run:

```
docker run --rm --name slate -v $(pwd)/build:/srv/slate/build -v $(pwd)/source:/srv/slate/source slatedocs/slate build
```

After this command completes, you should see the built artifacts for your site in the `$(pwd)/build` directory, which you can then statically serve for your website.

_Note_: You may omit the final `build` argument and get the same result. By default, if given no command, the Dockerfile will run `build`.

## Running in Development Mode

If you wish to run the development server for Slate to aid in working on the site, run:

```
docker run --rm --name slate -p 4567:4567 -v $(pwd)/source:/srv/slate/source slatedocs/slate serve
```

and you will be able to access your site at http://localhost:4567 until you stop the running container process.
